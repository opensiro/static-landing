# opensiro-web

Static multi-page site for **opensiro** — the company building the toolchain for
organizations that compile, and the ARCTIC reasoning benchmark.

The design uses Departure Mono, warm off-white backgrounds, sharp corners,
hairline dividers, and pale blue artwork with darker blue link accents. The home page explains the
work in plain language; each product has its own animated pixel mark.
Built as plain HTML/CSS/JS, with no runtime dependencies.

## Stack

Plain static site — **no build step, no dependencies, no framework.** All fonts and mascot artwork are bundled locally and served from `assets/`.

Runtime remains dependency-free. Regenerating the stabilized mascot GIF requires Pillow:
`uv run --no-project --with pillow python scripts/stabilize-mascot-gif.py`.

## Design language

| Token        | Value                              | Notes                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `--bg`       | `#faf9f6`                          | warm off-white, NOT pure white |
| `--ink`      | `#18181b`                          | zinc-900 text                  |
| `--hairline` | `rgba(0,0,0,.10)`                  | section/button dividers        |
| `--tint`     | `rgba(0,0,0,.04)`                  | 4% section wash                |
| `--accent`   | `#9bafd2`                          | pale blue marks, ARCTIC hover  |
| `--accent-ink` | `#49658e`                        | readable links and focus       |
| `--font`     | `'DepartureMono', monospace`       | one typeface, everywhere       |
| `--maxw`     | `1200px`                           | content width                  |

**Signature rules:**
- **Sharp corners** — `border-radius:0` everywhere except 6px status dots.
- **1px hairline borders** that fully invert on hover (fill ↔ outline swap).
- **Plain body copy** — sentence case, readable line lengths, uppercase reserved
  for small labels and navigation.
- **Clear hierarchy** — centered hero compositions, larger headings, and
  left-aligned product descriptions.
- **Dividers, not cards** — products separated by hairline lines, no boxed backgrounds.

## Motion and interactions

- `.vine-static` preserves the original bitmap vines along the home and product
  heroes. A smaller, muted `.vine-center` garden grows continuously behind the
  home and product copy. Tendrils gently explore before curling; sweeping, spring-like,
  and short flowering growth alternate. Stems keep their own direction with
  smooth joins. New randomized bends and flowers attach to existing stems; the
  viewport moves at a constant speed after the initial growth, letting older
  sections leave the bottom edge. Flowering does not change the camera speed.
  There is no fade, reset, or accumulating tangle. Offscreen sections
  are removed to keep the document bounded. Pause/Resume controls the garden;
  it also pauses offscreen and in hidden tabs. Reduced motion shows a completed
  still ornament; without JavaScript only the original static vines remain.
- Home and Products share the same hero layout. The garden keeps the visible
  branch recipes, growth position, and Pause state in per-tab session storage,
  including when returning through browser history. Only the visible sections
  are saved; reconstruction does not replay the full session. Storage failure
  falls back to a fresh local garden. Native cross-document view transitions
  change the hero copy in 200 ms while keeping the garden opaque. Deep links,
  scrolled pages, and reduced motion use ordinary navigation. Browsers without
  view transitions still restore the garden. Run the dependency-free lifecycle
  checks with `node tests/garden-sync.test.cjs`.
- The ARCTIC preview and research hero end in a black mountain silhouette.
  Hovering the section or focusing a link inside it turns the mountains pale blue.
- Each product has a separate locally served SVG mark with a small animation.
- The full OpenSiro article uses a fixed bottom table of contents. Its pale-blue
  glider follows the visible section; on mobile, the links scroll horizontally
  to keep the active section in view.
- Research includes Stack push/pop, Pills, and Tic-tac-toe training pairs, animated once with replay
  controls, and two task-derived hero assets. The diagrams use the source grids
  and palette. See `assets/arctic/README.md` for source, attribution, and rebuilding.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` shows the full vines and static product marks and
  keeps the existing still-image fallback for the mascot.
- Products and Research stay visible in the header on mobile, with no drawer.
  Both decorative side vines remain visible down to 320 px. Links and buttons
  have visible keyboard focus.

## Pages

| Route             | File            | Content                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `/`               | `index.html`    | Hero, introduction, three-step approach, products & ARCTIC |
| `/products.html`  | `products.html` | vsmlite + opensiro detail blocks            |
| `/research.html`  | `research.html` | ARCTIC detail + stats + CTA               |

Each page shares the same sticky header (logo + Products/Research nav), footer
(copyright + site links + font attribution). Social links are paused in HTML
comments, ready to restore when the channels are available. The active nav item is
marked with `.active` in markup and re-asserted by `app.js` from
`location.pathname`.

## Links

Inter-page links are relative. External product links point at GitHub:

- `https://github.com/opensiro/terminal-bench-vsm` — vsmlite repo
- `https://github.com/opensiro/arctic-0` — ARCTIC-0 public archive

Paused social links (not rendered): `twitter.com/opensiro`, `youtube.com/@opensiro`,
`discord.gg/opensiro`.

## Run

Open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# → http://localhost:8000/
# → http://localhost:8000/products.html
# → http://localhost:8000/research.html
```

## Deploy

Push to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.). No build, no
`npm install`. When migrating to a framework, the shared header/footer/nav are
the natural extraction points into a layout component.
